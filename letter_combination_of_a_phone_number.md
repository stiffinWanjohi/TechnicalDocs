# Generating Letter Combinations from Phone Numbers

## Problem Statement

Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive, we need to return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. The mapping of digits to letters is the same as the traditional phone keypad layout.

Here's the mapping:

```
2 -> ['a', 'b', 'c']
3 -> ['d', 'e', 'f']
4 -> ['g', 'h', 'i']
5 -> ['j', 'k', 'l']
6 -> ['m', 'n', 'o']
7 -> ['p', 'q', 'r', 's']
8 -> ['t', 'u', 'v']
9 -> ['w', 'x', 'y', 'z']
```

We need to return the answer in any order.

## Examples

**Example 1:**

```
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: digits = ""
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: digits = "2"
Output: ["a", "b", "c"]
```

## Constraints

- `0 <= digits.length <= 4`
- `digits[i]` is a digit in the range `['2', '9']`

## Approach 1: Backtracking

The backtracking approach is a recursive solution that generates all possible letter combinations by building them up character by character. It explores all possible paths by recursively generating combinations and backtracks when necessary.

### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        if not digits:
            return []

        digit_map = {
            '2': 'abc',
            '3': 'def',
            '4': 'ghi',
            '5': 'jkl',
            '6': 'mno',
            '7': 'pqrs',
            '8': 'tuv',
            '9': 'wxyz'
        }

        result = []

        def backtrack(combination, next_digits):
            if not next_digits:
                result.append(combination)
                return

            chars = digit_map[next_digits[0]]

            for char in chars:
                backtrack(combination + char, next_digits[1:])

        backtrack("", digits)

        return result
```

### Execution Process

1. The `backtrack` function is recursively called with an empty combination and the entire input string.
2. For each character mapped to the current digit, a new recursive call is made with the combination extended by that character and the remaining digits.
3. When the length of the current combination becomes equal to the length of the input string, the combination is added to the result list.
4. The function backtracks to the previous level of recursion and continues generating combinations by exploring the remaining characters.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(3^N \* 4^M), where N is the number of digits that map to 3 letters, and M is the number of digits that map to 4 letters.
- Space Complexity: O(3^N \* 4^M), as all possible combinations need to be stored.

## Approach 2: Optimized Iterative Approach (Mapping Guarded Recursive Approach / Optimized Queue)

The optimized iterative approach is a more efficient solution that directly generates the final combinations in a single step for each digit, avoiding the overhead of recursive function calls.

### Implementation

```python
class Solution:
    def letterCombinations(self, digits: str) -> List[str]:
        if not digits:
            return []

        digit_map = {
            '2': 'abc',
            '3': 'def',
            '4': 'ghi',
            '5': 'jkl',
            '6': 'mno',
            '7': 'pqrs',
            '8': 'tuv',
            '9': 'wxyz'
        }

        result = [""]

        for digit in digits:
            chars = digit_map[digit]
            result = [prev + char for char in chars for prev in result]

        return result
```

### Execution Process

1. The process starts with an initial list `result` containing an empty string.
2. For each digit, the characters mapped to that digit are retrieved from the `digit_map`.
3. A list comprehension is used to generate a new `result` list by appending each character from the current digit to each existing string in the current `result` list.
4. After processing all digits, the final list of combinations is stored in the `result` list, which is returned.

### Complexity Analysis

- Time Complexity: O(3^N \* 4^M), where N is the number of digits that map to 3 letters, and M is the number of digits that map to 4 letters.
- Space Complexity: O(3^N \* 4^M), as all possible combinations need to be stored.

Although the time and space complexities are the same as the backtracking approach in the worst case, the optimized iterative approach is generally faster and more efficient in practice due to its simplicity and lack of unnecessary overhead, especially for longer input strings.

## Comparative Analysis

Both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks, and the choice of approach may depend on the specific requirements of the problem, such as input size, performance constraints, and code readability preferences.

The backtracking approach is a recursive solution that explores all possible paths and backtracks when necessary. It is more intuitive and easier to understand for those familiar with recursion. However, it can lead to a larger number of function calls and memory overhead, especially for longer input strings.

On the other hand, the optimized iterative approach is a more efficient solution that generates the combinations in a more direct and efficient manner, avoiding unnecessary overhead. It is generally faster and more memory-efficient in practice, although the theoretical time and space complexities are the same as the backtracking approach in the worst case.

In most scenarios, the optimized iterative approach is recommended due to its efficiency and simplicity. However, the backtracking approach may be preferred in certain situations where recursive solutions are more suitable or when code readability is a higher priority.

## Conclusion

In this technical document, we have explored the problem of generating letter combinations from a string of digits representing a phone number. We presented two different approaches: the backtracking approach and the optimized iterative approach (Mapping Guarded Recursive Approach / Optimized Queue).

While both approaches have the same time and space complexities in the worst case, the optimized iterative approach is generally faster and more efficient in practice due to its simplicity and lack of unnecessary overhead, especially for longer input strings.

We provided detailed explanations, implementations in Python, visual representations of the execution processes, and complexity analyses for both approaches. Additionally, we conducted a comparative analysis, highlighting the advantages and drawbacks of each approach, and provided recommendations for choosing the appropriate solution based on specific requirements.

By understanding the strengths and weaknesses of these approaches, developers can make informed decisions when solving similar problems and optimize their solutions for efficiency and performance.
